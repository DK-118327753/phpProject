        <h1>Sports</h1>
            <div>In the following section I will discuss all of my sporting interests and events I have partaken in.</div>
            
        <br>
            
        <h2>Running</h2>
        <img src="RunningSection.jpg" class="img" />
            <p>As a younger child, I never really took part in any activities due to my troubles with dyspraxia.</p>
            <p>However, in my late adolescence I began to grow a fondness for running in local races.</p>
            <p>I began to participate in running when I was 16, and have since entered into annual 5k run.</p>
            <p>Partaking in runs has encouraged me to live a more active and health-conscious lifestyle.</p>
            
        <br>
        
        <h2>Gym</h2>
        <img src="GymSection.jpg" class="img" />
            <p>Along with running, I would also stick to an exercise regieme at home to help me press forward 
               and improve my general fitness.</p>
            <p>However, once I began attending college this was no longer possible since I was away from home
               and my current residence is too small a space to properly have a workout.</p>
            <p>Thus I started checking out the local gym, the Maridyke complex, which the college provides
               free membership to for its students.</p>
            <p>It is difficult to find a balance between the studies of college and society activities to
               get enough time in the gym. But when the time arises I try to make the best of it.</p>
        
        <br>
            
        <h2>Ultimate Frisbee</h2>
        <img src="FrisbeeSection.jpeg" class="img" />
            <p>As part of my first semester, I decided to try out the frisbee club.</p>
            <p>In the beginning I found it quite fun and entertaining, thinking it would be a nice alternative to the gym.</p>
            <p>This continued until the beginning of the second semester, where I felt my time management was going poorly.</p>
            <p>Thus I had to drop it for this term. I hope to return to it sometime in the future as I did enjoy my time with the team</p>
